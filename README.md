# Troygenics2019
This is the github of the iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2019. It contains python scripts for calculating the likelihood of S. cerevisiae developing resistance against a Cas13a-based Cell Death Inducing system. Additionally, we created python scripts for identifying the optimal split point for Npu DnaE mediated protein splicing.
